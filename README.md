# Website-Assessment-
Basic theatre booking system using HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL, the design of the website was not part of the assessment and this is something I intend on teaching myself and updating the website accordingly in the future.

The website allows the user to view the current performances at the theatre, view the available seats for said performance, and make a booking with their name and email address.
